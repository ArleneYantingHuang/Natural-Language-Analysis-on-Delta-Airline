# Natural-Language-Analysis-on-Delta-Airline
Natural Language Processing Project on Delta (Python)



## Overview
This is the term project I lead in Natural Language Processing Course held in School of Professional Studies from Columbia University in 2020 Summer.


## Project Details
### Part I Background & Project Goal
In the first half-year of 2020, airlines business was heavily affected by coronaries. We want to know how especially airlines were affected, so we choose Delta as our company and will focus on the topic of stock market analysis. Our project goal is to analyze the performance of Deltaâ€™s stock market in the past one month.

### Part II Data Sources
To analyze the effects, we use articles related to Delta and its stock price in the latest 30 days. The articles are news crawled from webhose, whose length is about 35000. As for stock price, we downloaded the CSV file from Yahoo Finance to get the daily price. Besides, we will update the stock price in the following days, as the influence of articles might last for a few days.

### Part III Methodology
i) Entity analysis (important named entities will be identified; i.e. related companies as well as important countries and cities)  
ii) Topic and sentiment analysis over the whole dataset.  
iii) Topic- Sentiment analysis over stock price / stock price change.
